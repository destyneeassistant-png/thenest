{q:"A 45-year-old client presents with symptoms that meet most but not all criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. The symptoms cause significant distress but don't fit the full diagnostic picture. According to DSM-5 classification principles, what is the MOST appropriate diagnosis?",o:["Other Specified Depressive Disorder","Unspecified Depressive Disorder","Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood","Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)"],a:0,e:"Other Specified Disorder is used when symptoms cause significant distress/impairment but don't meet full criteria for a specific disorder, AND the clinician wishes to specify WHY criteria weren't met. This differs from Unspecified (used when clinician doesn't specify the reason)."},
{q:"A psychologist is documenting a case where a child shows clear signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder but the full diagnostic assessment cannot be completed due to the family's sudden relocation. Which diagnostic notation should be used?",o:["Autism Spectrum Disorder, Unspecified","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Other Specified","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Provisional","Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder"],a:2,e:"A Provisional diagnosis is used when there is a strong presumption that the full criteria will be met, but insufficient information is available to make a firm diagnosis."},
{q:"The DSM-5, published in 2013, differs from previous editions in its approach to mental disorder classification. Which BEST describes the DSM-5's organizational approach?",o:["Dimensional approach with spectrum-based diagnoses","Purely categorical approach with discrete diagnostic boundaries","Categorical approach with some dimensional elements","Completely atheoretical with no organizational structure"],a:2,e:"While DSM-5 maintains a primarily categorical approach, it incorporates some dimensional elements (e.g., severity specifiers, cross-cutting symptom measures)."},

Her symptoms began in early adulthood and are consistent across multiple contexts. This presentation falls under which major DSM-5 diagnostic category?",o:["Personality Disorders","Bipolar and Related Disorders","Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders","Dissociative Disorders"],a:0,e:"The description matches Borderline Personality Disorder. Key differentiators: symptoms are pervasive across contexts, stable over time, and represent personality traits rather than episodic mood episodes."},
{q:"A psychiatrist notes that a patient's symptoms are consistent with a mood disorder but chooses not to specify which subtype. The clinical picture is unclear. What diagnosis should be recorded?",o:["Other Specified Mood Disorder","Unspecified Mood Disorder","Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition","Substance/Medication-Induced Mood Disorder"],a:1,e:"Unspecified Disorder is used when symptoms cause clinically significant distress but the clinician chooses NOT to specify the reason that criteria are not met, or has insufficient information."},
{q:"In DSM-5 classification, where would a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria be located?",o:["Sexual Dysfunctions","Paraphilic Disorders","Its own separate category","Elimination Disorders"],a:2,e:"Gender Dysphoria has its own separate chapter in DSM-5.

This represents a change from DSM-IV where it was considered a symptom of OCD."},
{q:"According to DSM-5, when making a provisional diagnosis, the clinician is indicating that:",o:["The diagnosis is suspected but definitive criteria are not yet met","The symptoms are mild and don't meet full severity criteria","The diagnosis is temporary and expected to resolve within 6 months","The patient has both symptoms and full syndrome criteria met"],a:0,e:"A provisional diagnosis indicates strong presumption that full criteria will ultimately be met, but not enough information is currently available to be certain."},
{q:"A patient presents with involuntary motor movements and vocalizations that began in childhood. These symptoms wax and wane in severity. This presentation is classified in which chapter of DSM-5?",o:["Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Movement Disorders","Neurocognitive Disorders","Tic Disorders, a separate category"],a:0,e:"Tourette's Disorder and other tic disorders are classified under Neurodevelopmental Disorders in DSM-5.
